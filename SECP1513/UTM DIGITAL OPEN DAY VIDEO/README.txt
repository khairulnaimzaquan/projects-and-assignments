📌 UTMDigital Open Day 2025 | 29 October 2025

On 29 October 2025, I am given the opportunity to attend UTMDigital Open Day. It provided valuable insights on the way digital systems and technologies are implemented in real-world environment. I gained clearer understanding into areas like system development, networking, and IT security within a large organization like UTM.

The visit helped me to connect what I've learned during class to real-world applications. For example, I am able to understand how digital infrastructure supports daily operations. There were also various booths showcasing recent technologies. Seeing and hearing it directly from the industry practitioners further enhanced my interests in computer science.

All in all, the event was informative and beneficial. It was a meaningful experience that encouraged me to continue improving my technological knowledge and skills. I'm grateful for the opportunity and looking forward to learning more beyond the classroom.
