🎨 PPG Industry Talk | 20 November 2025 

On 20th November 2025, I was given the opportunity to attend an industry talk by PPG. PPG is a global painting and coating company that provides 
ideal solutions for architectural, performance, and industrial coatings. Their aim is to meet customers' expectations with innovative paints and 
coatings. The talk was focused on how their IT department keeps the business running. PPG also introduced how they operate globally by using data 
analytics, global infrastructure, and SAP. Throughout the session, I was given a clear view on how real-world systems operate, including the need 
to manage large data, communicate across countries, and handle complex problems. Finally, me and my team had created a poster to summarize the talk.
