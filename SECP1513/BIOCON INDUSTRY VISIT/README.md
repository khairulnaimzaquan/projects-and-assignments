💉Industry Visit to Biocon | 23 December 2025

On 23 December 2025, I had the opporturnity to attend an industry visit to Biocon Sdn. Bhd. accompanied by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Azurah binti Abu Samah. I visited the Drug Product department, 
where insulins are produced. The instructor, Mr.Jaya explained the process of insulin manufacturing from yeast fermentation all the way to packaging. During the visit, I was able to observe 
how various machines and systems work together in a highly coordinated and controlled environment in order to produce pharmaceutical products. This exposure provided a clear understanding 
of industrial processes and automation in a real manufacturing environment.

The experience reflected greatly reflected my course of study, allowing me to relate theories learned in class with actual industy practices. It was an insightful opportunity that increased 
my appreciation on technologies related to pharmaceutical industry. I would like to express my gratitude to Biocon for the warm hospitality and for sharing valuable insights throughout the visit.
