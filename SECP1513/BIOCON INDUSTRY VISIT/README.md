💉Industry Visit to Biocon | 23 December 2025

On 23 December 2025, I had the opportunity to attend an industry visit to Biocon Sdn. Bhd. accompanied by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Azurah binti Abu Samah. 
I visited the Drug Product department, where insulins are produced. The instructor, Mr. Jaya, explained the process of insulin manufacturing from 
yeast fermentation all the way to packaging. During the visit, I was able to observe how various machines and systems work together in a highly 
coordinated and controlled environment in order to produce pharmaceutical products. This exposure provided a clear understanding of industrial 
processes and automation in a real manufacturing environment.

The experience greatly reflected my course of study, allowing me to relate theories learned in class with actual industry practices. It was an 
insightful opportunity that increased my appreciation of technologies related to the pharmaceutical industry. I would like to express my gratitude 
to Biocon for the warm hospitality and for sharing valuable insights throughout the visit.
