🎓Design Thinking Project | Digital Solutions for Autism & ADHD Community

As part of my SECP1513 assignment, me and my team were given a design thinking project to develop a digital solution for the Autism & 
ADHD Community. This project has impacted my way of identifying problems, generating ideas, and designing solutions. It also encouraged
me to find innovative solutions that are needed in the real world. All the details of this project can be found in the report below.
