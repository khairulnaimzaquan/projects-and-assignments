🎓Design Thinking Project | Digital Solutions for Autism & ADHD Community

As part of my SECP1513 assignment, me and my team were given a design thinking project to develop a digital solution for Autism & ADHD Community. This project had impacted my way of identifying problems, generating ideas, and designing solutions. It also encouraged me to find innovative solutions that are needed in the real world. All the details of this project can be found in the report.
