🔊Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd Industry Talk | 18 December 2025

On 18th December 2025, I had the opportunity to attend another industry talk about project management and system development. The talk
was given by Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib, Head of the Technology and Innovation Department of Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd.

He shared tons of knowledge about the system development life cycle, which is a fundamental approach used to create, design, and manage 
information systems. He also did explain the pros and cons of both SDLC approaches, waterfall and agile. Furthermore, he briefed us on 
agentic coding and its important role in today's technological era. He stated that most computer science-related jobs nowadays require 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) support for better production rates.

All in all, the talk was very inspirational and provided us with lots of knowledge in the field of computer science. It motivates me to 
keep trying my best and gain as much knowledge as possible. Finally, we had written an academic report covering the contents of the talk.
