On 18th December 2025, I had the opprtunity to attend another industry talk about Project Management and System Development. The talk was given by Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology and Innovation department of Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd.

He shared tons of knowledge about system development life cycle which is a fundamental approach used to create, design, and manage information systems. He also did explain the pros and cons of both SDLC approach, waterfall and agile. Furthermore, he briefed us on agentic coding and it's important role in today's technological era. He stated that most comouter science related jobs nowadays require Artificial Intelligence (AI) support for better production rate.

All in all, the talk was very inspirational and provided us with lots of knowledge in the field of computer science. It motivates me to keep trying my best and gain as many knowledge as possible. Finally, we had written an academic report covering the contents of the talk.
